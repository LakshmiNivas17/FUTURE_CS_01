Web Application Security Testing
🔒 Cybersecurity Vulnerability Assessment Project

I successfully completed a hands-on cybersecurity internship project focused on the vulnerability assessment of a real-world/open-source web application. Using ethical hacking tools and following the OWASP Top 10 standards, I identified critical security flaws and documented remediation strategies.

This project simulates real client work, such as securing the websites of startups, SaaS companies, and e-commerce platforms.

🚀 Key Highlights

Performed vulnerability scans using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux utilities.

Identified vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and Security Misconfigurations.

Mapped all findings to the OWASP Top 10 (2021) categories.

Compiled results into a professional security report aligned with industry standards.

📂 Outcome

This project not only enhanced my understanding of how attackers exploit web applications but also taught me effective defense strategies.
The final security report has been added to this repository as part of my portfolio.

🛠️ Tools I have Used

DVWA – Damn Vulnerable Web Application for practicing attacks
OWASP ZAP – Open-source vulnerability scanner
Kali Linux (optional) – Security testing OS with built-in tools
